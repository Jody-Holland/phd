## Progress This Week

-   Moved into College and restarted work

-   Have determined what funding is available to me through my bursary (£75 a month for books, £3000 over the course for conferences, £500 a year for equipment).

    -   Also some osptions for field work funding in SEA
        -   Notably the Selena Sun Travel and Research Fund from Trinity
        -   Deadline for Applications is the 13th February 2026
        -   Covers China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar (bad idea!), Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines ect.

-   Started Feasibility Report plan and made good progress

    -   Fleshed out background section (500 words)
    -   Have aimed to produce a brief overview of the current "state of the science"
    -   Pretty happy with the introduction

-   Made a flow chart outlining the local leakage methods

    -   [PDF of flowchart is here](files/chapter1_plan.pdf)

-   Began work on a conceptual framework to hypothesise what could induce a landscape to be more or less prone to local leakage

    -   Emphasised the context of the economic activities occurring
    -   Exploring the concept of "Factor Mobility"
        -   A concept taken from New Economic Geography (Krugman etc.)
        -   Denotes the degree to which an activity/industry could move across borders and landscapes
        -   Incorporates both how mobile the workforce might be and how regionally specific a particular activity might be
    -   Also examined how landscape topography could interact with local leakage propensity beyond factor mobility
        -   Specifically the positioning on the protected area within the landscape
        -   PAs are often located in the most politically convenient places - not the most ecologically critical
        -   Could mean that there is little economic pressure on the periphery of projects
        -   Could also mean that the people living in the vicinity of the PA have little political or economic power to resist the imposition of a PA

-   Read Dasguta's On Natural Capital

    -   Not too much that I hadn't already been introduced to
    -   Was a pretty eloquent framing of ecological damage as a "tragedy of the commons" in absence of accurate pricing of natural captial

-   Studied Brodie et al. (2023)

    -   Pretty fascinating how they conclude that PAs can have positive impacts on biodiversity across a landscape
    -   Notably in the case of mammals they find that PAs could lead to safeguarded source populations
        -   That would incur density driven dispersal of animals across a landscape, even if that landscape is degraded habitat
    -   This could mean that even if we see elevated habitat destruction around a project there could nonetheless be positive spillovers for biodiversity in the landscape
        -   Land Sparing wins again?

-   Studied Lui and Coomes (2015)

    -   They find no evidence for local leakage

    -   Some issues with their approach (no dynamic baselines)

    -   Also they don't explore any link between the relative rate of additionality within projects and any rate of leakage in the buffer

-   Set up Quarto website for progress tracking

    -   When new reports are made they are automatically rendered as html, word, and pdf formats and added to the site.

-   Began testing PACT V3 to see if it it fungible and robust

    -   Checked if the sum of additionality from Gola North, Central and South was equal to the additionality reading from running the project as a whole

        -   96.4% the same

    -   Started running PACT V3 across 35 placebo projects

-   Finished up some of the residual tasks for REDD+ paper

-   Began running carbon density analysis on Gola Buffer villages

-   Got my head around the Zoology PhD training log

-   Had a look at the Choice of Advisors page

    -   Currently looking at Lynn Dicks and Ed Turner

## Problems Encountered

-   College is taking some time paying me my stipend, hopefully will be resolved soon (I have some savings to dip into so not an issue
-   Due to not having accommodation, I was unable to attend the induction day, although I have made up for this by attending the safety workshop later, I have yet to meet any other Zoology PhD students other than Robin in Rob's group
-   I'm having difficulties making sure my Feasibility Report sections are succinct and direct.
    -   Specifically, what is the core message I want to communicate in the background section?
    -   500 words to summarise the "state of science" around tropical forest leakage
    -   Struggling to maintain *message discipline*
    -   Also want to find space to add in 'Biodiversity Leak' paper
-   With the section on research plan, I'm trying to neatly split the CLOCs and BLOCs concept into individual separated studies
    -   Should one chapter be about the nuances and trades offs in building the map and another be its utilities and uses.
    -   This is inspired by Ali's approach to LIFE
        -   Paper on how it works
        -   Paper demonstrating it's uses
    -   For methods, I'm struggling to determine how detailed I need to be
        -   Word limitations are significant \*(500-100)
        -   I need to determine what isa the appropriate and realistic experimental design for local leakage
        -   I think I will include my conceptual framework into the report
-   Resources and Costs section
    -   A bit confusing, costs at the moment are minimal
    -   But this could change if I do field work and an exchange
    -   I also plan to attend conferences (BES ect.) should I put this down
-   Training
    -   Need to find training courses relevant to my aims
        -   Hoping to find public speaking training, as well as econometric refreshers
        -   Also looking into TESSERA workshops and if they count as training

## Plans for Next Week

-   Finish Research Aims section of Feasibility Report

    -   Make a secondary flowchart outlining CLOCs and BLOCs

-   Sign onto a training course to happen in November

-   Draft a short field work idea to have in the back-pocket

-   Arrange TESSERA training workshop (talk to Keshav at next weeks lab lunch)

-   Produce the placebo results of PACT to allow us to know its relative predictive accuracy around the world (for SI of chapter 1)

-   Identify the set of REDD+ project and their metadata to run leakage analysis on

-   Determine the metrics to be used for damage in leakage analysis

    -   Forest cover

    -   Extinction Risk

    -   Forest Carbon

-   Study the following papers for potential reference and guidance for the Feasibility Report.
