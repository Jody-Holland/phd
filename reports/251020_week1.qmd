## Progress This Week

-   Moved into College and restarted work

-   Have determiend what funding is available to me through my bursary (£75 a month for books, £3000 over the course for conferences, £500 a year for equipment).

    -   Also some options for field work funding in SEA

-   Started Feasibility Report and made good progress

    -   Fleshed out background section (500 words)
    -   Have aimed to produce a brief overview of the current "state of the science"
    -   Pretty happy with the introduction

-   Began work on a conceptual framework to hypothesise what could induce a landscape to be more or less prone to local leakage

    -   Emphasised the context of the economic activities occurring
    -   Exploring the concept of "Factor Mobility"
        -    A concept taken from New Economic Geography (Krugman etc.)
        -   Denotes the degree to which an activity/industry could move across borders and landscapes
        -   Incorporates both how mobile the workforce might be and how regionally specific a particular activity might be
    -   Also examined how landscape topography could interact with local leakage propensity beyond factor mobility
        -   Specifically the positioning on the protected area within the landscape
        -   PAs are often located in the most politically convenient places - not the most ecologically critical
        -   Could mean that there is little economic pressure on the periphery of projects
        -   Could also mean that the people living in the vicinity of the PA have little political or economic power to resist the imposition of a PA

-   Read Dasguta's Natural Capital

    -   Not too much that I hadn't already been introduced to
    -   Was a pretty eloquent framing of ecological damage as a "tragedy of the commons" in absence of accurate pricing of natural captial

-   Studied Brodie et al. (2023)

    -   Pretty fascinating how they conclude that PAs can have positive impacts on biodiversity across a landscape
    -   Notably in the case of mammals they find that PAs could lead to safeguarded source populations
        -   That would incur density driven dispersal of animals across a landscape, even if that landscape is degraded habitat
    -   This could mean that even if we see elevated habitat destruction around a project there could nonetheless be positive spillovers for biodiversity in the landscape
        -   Land Sparing wins again?

-   Set up Quarto website for progress tracking

    -   When new reports are made they are automatically rendered as html, word, and pdf formats and added to the site.

-   Began testing PACT V3 if it

## Problems Encountered

-   Learning curve with Quarto
-   Setting up proper file organization

## Plans for Next Week

-   Create next weekly report
-   Add more content structure
-   Begin detailed literature review
